    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Welcome to this demo movie recommender application.  This demo has been installed with approximately four thousand movies and 500,000 ratings.  The ratings have been generated randomly.  The purpose of this web application is to allow users to search for movies, rate movies, and receive recommendations for movies based on their ratings.
    <p>To get started:
    <ul>
        {% if not current_user.is_authenticated %}
        <li>New users: <a href="{{ url_for('auth.register') }}">Register</a> for an account</li>
        <li>Existing users: <a href="{{ url_for('auth.login') }}">Login</a> to your account</li>
        {% endif %}
        <li>Use the Search box in the header to search for and rate some movies</li>
        <li><a href="{{ url_for('main.recommendations') }}">Get Recommendations</a> for movies</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> The goal of this webapp is to show Apache Spark Machine Learning. Therefore, some functionality is missing and it doesn't have the polish that you would expect from a commercial movie recommendation web site.</p>

    <h2>Running your own demo instance</h2>

    <p><a href="https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/snowch/movie-recommender-demo.git"><img src="https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png" alt="Deploy to Bluemix"></a>
    &nbsp;You can deploy your own instance of this web application (plus Cloudant and Compose Redis). Click on the button and follow the instructions. 
        <em>CAUTION: a python flask application instance with 128MB memory and an instance of Cloudant 'Lite' and an instance of Compose for Redis 'Standard' will get deployed in your Bluemix account - you may get charged for these services.  Please check charges before deploying.</em></p>
    <p>After deploying to Bluemix, you will need to create a new <a href="http://datascience.ibm.com">DSX</a> project and import the notebooks (see the Source Code section below).  The notebook <em>Step 07 - Cloudant Datastore Recommender.ipynb</em> is responsible for creating recommendations and saving the recommendations to Cloudant.  You will not get recommendations until you have run this notebook.</p>
